# Developer Preferences

This file contains preferences for how Claude Code should interact with this project.

## Database Migrations

**Do not ask to run migrations.** Always instruct the developer to run migrations themselves rather than offering to run them.

When migration files are created, simply tell the developer:
- "Run `npm run generate-data`"

## Other Preferences

(Add additional preferences here as needed)
